# Research Philosophy
"*Does a machine merely imitate life?
Or does it embody the principles of life within its circuits?*"

This question defines the journey and purpose of our research ㅡ
the guiding star of our exploration.

# NX-ReAG | Structured AI Research Repository

This repository serves as the official documentation and publication space
for technical research on structured transformer circuits, nonlinear interference systems,
and mathematically isomorphic architectures in emerging AI design.

---

## Repository Structure

- docs : Public-facing HTML files and transparency notices

- papers : Published papers and technical manuscripts

- schemas : Mathematical models, functional diagrams, circuit logic (public-safe subset)

- archives : Timestamp records and structural snapshots

---

## Current Focus (updated)

- Nonlinear interference–based computation

- Mathematical isomorphism in dynamic circuit models

- Structured token propagation and trace calibration

- Formalization of transformer-based alignment mechanisms *(under active experimentation)*

- Resonant Memory Trace Architecture (RMT-Arch) *(under active experimentation)*

- Multi‑phase emergent circuit alignment (phase/velocity/consistency orchestration)

---

## Integrity & Provenance (reinforced)

All public files in this repository adopt minimal-disclosure policy and are protected via:

- Git commit history (signed tags for milestone releases)

- Archive snapshots via the Wayback Machine

- Independent hash-based trace validation (archives checksums)

- Access transparency: non-invasive analytics(non-tracking) + anomaly watch (country-of-origin patterning)

---

⚠ Unauthorized duplication, extraction, automated scraping, or de‑obfuscation attempts are prohibited.
Core algorithms, internal parameters, and experiment logs are not disclosed in this repository.

---

## Research Policy

This repository is intended for scientific and educational purposes under a controlled documentation regime.
Documents describe concepts, interfaces, and high-level workflows. They do not reveal full implementations.

To ensure transparency and safety:

- Public materials focus on concepts, interfaces, and neutral summaries.

- Core circuit alignment, interference handling, and parameterization remain private until further notice.

- Provenance evidence (archives + hashes) is provided for public artifacts.

## Development Timeline (updated)

|Date	|Event |
|:----------|:----------|
|2025‑07‑29	| Initial NX‑ReAG technical draft uploaded |
|2025‑08‑**	| Repository restructuring for public‑neutral mode |
|2025‑08‑** |	Sica technology confirmed under national strategic classification (code noted in internal records) |
|2025‑08‑** |	PCT preparation initiated; disclosure scope aligned with patent strategy|
|2025‑09‑** |	Mathematical isomorphism model (neutral summary) to be published |

Note: Public scope here follows patent timelines. Detailed implementations are withheld until filing windows close.
