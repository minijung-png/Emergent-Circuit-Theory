# Repository Update Notice


We experienced a brief hiatus in repository activity for structural reorganization and security review.
This pause was part of our planned refinement to ensure data integrity and alignment with ongoing research.

We will soon resume with extensive updates, including:

- Newly structured research documents

- Expanded technical models and circuit frameworks

- Transparency reports and archive proofs

Thank you for your patience â€” the next update will mark a major step forward in our work.
