# Security Policy


This repository documents and publishes selected research results on **structured resonance circuits, nonlinear interference, and AI alignment.** Because of the sensitivity of these topics, we follow a **minimal disclosure** and **responsible transparency** policy.

---

## Supported Versions

- Public documents (in `/docs`) are safe for open access.  
- Technical manuscripts (in `/papers`) follow controlled disclosure.  
- Models and circuit diagrams (in `/schemas`) include only non-sensitive subsets.  
- Archive records (in `/archives`) provide provenance proofs but not raw logs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any issue that could:
- expose hidden circuit logic,
- reveal non-public algorithms,
- bypass transparency boundaries,
- or create unintended dual-use risks,

please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, contact directly via:

- Email: 2023ppcc@gmail.com  
- Repository Issues (only with public-safe, redacted details)

All sensitive reports will be reviewed under NDA-based collaboration, if necessary.

## Security Principles

1. **Minimal Disclosure**  
   Only safe, high-level conceptual content is published. Core algorithms remain private.

2. **Integrity & Provenance**  
   All public files are protected by git commit history, signed tags, hash-based verification, and archive snapshots.

3. **Dual-Use Awareness**  
   Research that could be misapplied for harmful purposes is withheld until adequate safeguards and patents are established.

4. **Collaborative Safety**  
   Community feedback is welcome, but contributions must respect confidentiality and controlled disclosure boundaries.

## Notes

This repository is a **scientific archive** rather than a production system.  
Security reports should focus on information sensitivity and provenance, not software vulnerabilities.
